            <div>
                <p>I love taking care of incredible teams! My background in communications sciences combined with my early experience in the LATAM Esports scene led me to develop a listen-first approach that I have applied as Office Coordinator at Riot Games in Mexico City, where our team’s commitment to excellence earned our office the #2 spot in 2017’s list of Great Place to Work. I am proud of what we’ve accomplished, and I want to continue testing myself with inspiring teams that challenge me to deliver awesome every day. </p>
